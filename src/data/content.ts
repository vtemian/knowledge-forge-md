    story: `I launched a simple tool for freelancers to track their invoices. No audience, no followers, no money for ads. Just me and a keyboard.

**Month 1-2: The "just write content" phase**
I wrote 15 blog posts in 6 weeks. Generic stuff like "best invoicing tips" and "freelancer productivity hacks." Traffic? About 20 visits/day, mostly bots.

**Month 3: The turning point**
I stopped writing what I thought people wanted and started looking at what they actually searched for. Found a goldmine: "invoice template [country name]" had thousands of monthly searches with almost no competition.

**Month 4-5: Template pages explosion**
I created invoice template pages for 30 countries. Each page had a free downloadable template, local tax info, and currency formatting. This was tedious but brain-dead simple.

**Month 6: Results**
10,200 organic visitors/month. 340 signups. 12 paying customers. Not life-changing money but proof that SEO compounds.

**The uncomfortable truth**: Most of my traffic came from 3 pages out of 45. The Pareto principle is brutally real in SEO.`,

    story: `After 5 years in agencies, I was burnt out. I'd built beautiful apps for clients but had nothing of my own. So I did what every developer does — I started building a todo app with AI.

**The failed cool idea**
3 months and $400 in OpenAI credits later, I had a beautiful AI-powered task manager that nobody wanted. I showed it to 50 people. They said "cool!" and never came back.

**The boring pivot**
My girlfriend is an accountant. She complained daily about manually copying numbers between her clients' invoices and the tax software. I built a simple CSV converter in a weekend.

She loved it. Her colleagues loved it. Their clients loved it.

**What "boring" looks like**
- No AI, no blockchain, no fancy animations
- Reads CSV files, reformats them, exports to the right format
- Charges €19/month per accounting firm
- 210 paying customers after 14 months

**The $4k MRR milestone**
I hit it in month 11. Not through Product Hunt or Twitter threads. Through cold emails to accounting firms and a single Google ad campaign targeting "import invoices to [tax software name]."

The boring stuff is where the money is. Nobody tweets about CSV converters, but accountants will pay for them every single month without complaining.`,

    date: "January 2026",
    story: `I'm a designer who got tired of making $0 from my Dribbble shots. I decided to package my design work into templates and sell them.

**The chicken-and-egg problem**
No audience → no sales → no motivation → no product. Classic indie hacker death spiral. I needed to break the loop somewhere.

**Building in public on Twitter**
I started posting my design process daily. Not polished case studies — raw screenshots, messy iterations, honest numbers. "Day 14: made $0 again. Here's what I'm trying next." People resonated with the honesty.

In 3 months, I went from 200 to 2,800 followers. Not massive, but enough to get 40 sales on my first template pack.

**Adding SEO to the mix**
Twitter gives you spikes. SEO gives you a baseline. I started writing blog posts targeting "free [tool name] templates" — Figma templates, Notion templates, etc.

The blog posts brought 3,000 visitors/month. Combined with Twitter spikes during launches, I hit consistent $2k/mo by month 8.

**The distribution stack that worked**
1. Twitter for brand awareness and launch spikes
2. SEO blog posts for steady organic traffic
3. A free Figma resource as lead magnet
4. Email list for launch announcements (800 subscribers)

No paid ads. No Product Hunt. No partnerships. Just consistent content on two channels.`,
